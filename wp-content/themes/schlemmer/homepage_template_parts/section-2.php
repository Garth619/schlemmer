				<p>The personal injury attorneys of The Schlemmer Firm have provided high quality legal services to accident and injury victims in New York City for over 20 years. Get the help you need from an attorney who will fight to defend your interests and secure the compensation and justice that you deserve. Our firm’s founder, Paul N. Schlemmer is board certified by the National Board in Trial Advocacy, an honor held by fewer than 4% of the attorneys in the United States. The Super Lawyers Publication has also selected Mr. Schlemmer as a top lawyer every year since 2010. This means that, when you work with us, a board-certified attorney with a passion for seeing injury victims treated fairly will oversee your case. We work each case to move it through the system as quickly as is prudent to ensure a fair outcome.</p>

<h2>Commitment to Excellence</h2>

<p>Recovering from an injury is often a long and painful process. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed and like the system is stacked against you. Insurance companies, corporate attorneys, and even New York state laws can leave you feeling all alone against the world. Our law firm is committed to giving your case the attention it deserves. We limit the caseloads of our attorneys and ensure we have the right staff to make sure each client gets the amount of attention you need. Not just for seeing you through your case, but seeing you through this incredibly difficult time. We focus on your case, so you can focus on your recovery.</p>

<h2>A record of success</h2>

<p>Many attorneys seem eager to accept a settlement offer and move on to the next client. At The Schlemmer Firm, we have tried nearly every type of liability case to verdict. You can rest assured that we will never advise you to accept a settlement that is not in your best interest. Our firm has a track record of winning, and we have obtained millions of dollars for past clients. Our attorneys also understand that for our clients winning isn’t just about money. We’ll work with you to offer professional assistance in putting your life back together. </p>

<p>If you have been injured due to the negligence of someone else, <span class="blue">The Schlemmer Firm is here to help.</span></p>
