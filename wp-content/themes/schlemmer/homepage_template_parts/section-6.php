				<p>Paul N. Schlemmer is board certified in civil trial advocacy by the National Board in Trial Advocacy. This distinction is unique, and held by only 4% of the lawyers in the U.S. This prestigious certification requires exceptional performance, as well as recommendations from peers and judges. In addition, Mr. Schlemmer is board certified in pre-trial advocacy by the National Board of Legal Specialty Certification.</p>
